TEI::Lite README
================

This library of Perl modules was designed as an interface for the easy 
creation and manipulation of XML documents conforming to the markup 
schema created by the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org/).
This group created a original SGML markup language they dubbed TEI which
could theoretically markup any text document a person might create.  The
original specification was quite large and to ease the use and help 
facilitate the transition to using this new markup, they created a subset
variation called TEI Lite.  TEI Lite markup though being a subset of the 
original specification is still powerful enough to markup "most" documents
created by man.  The TEI Lite model is starting to see increasing popularity
in libraries and electronic text archives.
